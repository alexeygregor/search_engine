Look before you leap.

A fox was once passing by a well after sunset. It had been dark. So he did not notice the well.
He slipped down into the well. He remained there all night and suffered much.
Somehow he saved himself from drowning. Near that well there lived a villager. The villager had a goat.
The goat was quite foolish.

In the morning, while grazing about, she went near the well. The fox on seeing the goat said,
"Come friend, you have not tasted such clear and sweet water in your life as you may find in this well.
Have drunk and drunk, and yet I want to drink." The foolish goat was a bit thirsty. She could not check herself.
She at once jumped into the well. The fox got upon the head of the goat and got out of the well.
