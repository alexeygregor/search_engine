Where there is a will there is a way.

One day it was very hot. A crow was very thirsty. He went out in search of water. He flew here and there.
At last, he saw a water pot. He flew to that pot. But he found that the water in it was at the bottom of the pot.
He tried again and again but could not reach the water with his beak. He was very sad.

But the crow was very clever, he found some pieces of stone at a small distance.
He carried them all to the water pot one by one.
He then dropped the stones into the pot until the water rose to it's brim.
Then he drank water and satisfied his thirst.
