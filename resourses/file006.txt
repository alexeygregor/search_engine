united we stand, divided we fall.

there was a farmer. he had four sons. they quarrelled with one another.
so the farmer was very anxious about their future. one day he called his sons to him. 
he told them to bring a bundle of sticks. they did so.
he then told each of the sons one after another to break the bundle of sticks.

they tried but in vain. then the farmer told them to untie the bundle and break the sticks one by one.
this time they could break the sticks easily. the farmer then advised them by saying,
"if you are united nobody will be able to harm you. you could not break the sticks in a bundle.
but you could easily break the sticks when they were separated. so live together in peace."
the sons promised to follow their father's advice.
