The Blue Jackal.

A jackal one night got into a washerman's house to steal some food.
By chance, he fell into the washerman's vat which was full of blue water.
Somehow he got out of the pot but he was dyed blue. He looked very strange.
He returned to the forest. No animal could recognize him.
All the animals were afraid. They made him their king.

The sun went down. After nightfall, the jackals howled as usual.
The blue jackal could not along with the other jackals. He howled at the top of his voice.
Then all the animals had no difficulty in knowing what their king really was.
The tiger came and tore him to pieces.
