Little friends may prove to be great friends.

A lion lived in a den. A mouse also lived in a hole nearby. One day the lion was sleeping.
The mouse was running up and down. By chance, the mouse got into the nostril of the lion.
The lion woke up. He was very angry. He caught the mouse with his paws and was about to kill it.
The mouse prayed for mercy. It said that it might be of use to him in the future.
The lion laughed at the small mouse and let it go.

After some days the lion was caught in a hunter's net. He could not tear the net. So he began to roar.
The mouse could know the lion from it's roar. It went there without losing time and gnawed into the net.
It said, "O king of beasts. I have cut into the net. Now run away for your life.
I have been able to do a good turn to you." The lion was glad and ran away.
