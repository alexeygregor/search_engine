a man and his ass.

a man dealt in salt. he had an ass to carry loads of salt from a distant town. there was a stream on the way.
the ass had to cross that river every day. one day the ass fell into the river. some of the salt melted in the water.
the load became lighter.

the ass felt relieved to some extent and became clever. it began to let it's feet slip every day.
the dealer suffered a great loss. he became very angry. he's wanted to teach the ass a good lesson.
he kept it without food for two days. the ass could realize it's fault. he never did such a thing again.
