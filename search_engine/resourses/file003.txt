the stag and the hunter.

one day a stag was thirsty. he went to drink water in a pool. the water in the pool was very clear.
the stag saw his own image in the pool. he was charmed to see his own horns. they were fine to look at.
so he admired them much. but he was sorry to see his thin legs.

they were very ugly to look at. all of a sudden a hunter came up there with his hounds.
the stag was afraid. he began to run away. his legs carried him as fast as they could.
but his horns got entangled with the creepers in the bushes. he was unable to run away.
the hunter came up there and killed him. his charming horns were the cause of his death.
