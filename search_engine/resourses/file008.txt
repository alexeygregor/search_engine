don't try a thing you don't know.

a fisherman was fishing in a river. he had fished for a long time and was tired.
he went to a house nearby to have a smoke. he left the net by the riverside.
there was a big tree beside the river. a monkey lived in that tree.
sitting at a distance, the monkey watched carefully how the fisherman threw his net and caught fish.

the monkey wished to throw the net into the river. so it went to the net.
it picked up the net and tried to throw it. but it was not an easy thing for the monkey to do.
in trying to do so it got entangled in the net. it tried hard but could not get free.
the fisherman came in the meantime. he was very angry. he beat the monkey to death.
