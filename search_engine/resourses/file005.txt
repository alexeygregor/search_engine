nobody trusts a liar.

once there was a cowboy. he tended his cows by the side of a forest.
to make fun, he would often cry out "tiger!", "tiger!". the villagers would come running to help him.
the cowboy stood giggling. the villagers got angry and went away.

they were befooled every time. one day a tiger really did come.
the cowboy cried and cried for help but none came to his help.
they thought that the cowboy was making fun of them as before. the tiger fell upon him and killed him.
